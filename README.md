# Coding Challenges
In this repository I collect all the algorithmic tasks I have solved. 
Each assignment has been solved by me, but not all solutions are mine.

## Table of contents
* [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/Kaliszando/coding-challenges#fizzbuzz)
* [Two smallest numbers](https://github.com/Kaliszando/coding-challenges#two-smallest-numbers)

## Particulars of the challenges

### FizzBuzz
_Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3' print "Fizz"
instead of the number and for the multiples of '5' print "Buzz"._

My solution returns String values instead of printing to console.

### Two smallest numbers
_Write a function that takes array of integer numbers and returns two elements,
the sum of which is smallest in a whole array_
