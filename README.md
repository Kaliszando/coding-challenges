# Coding Challenges
In this repository I collect all the algorithmic tasks I have solved. 
Each assignment has been solved by me, but not all solutions are mine.

## Particulars of the challenges



### FizzBuzz
***
_Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and for multiples of '3' print "Fizz"
instead of the number and for the multiples of '5' print "Buzz"._

My solution returns String values instead of printing to console.

### Two smallest numbers
***
_Write a function that takes array of integer numbers and returns two elements,
the sum of which is smallest in a whole array_  

Instead of sorting the array, you can traverse the array only once, which gives _O(n)_ complexity.

### Two sum
***
_Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
Array of integers is not sorted._

### Reverse integer
***
_Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range 
[-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.
**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**_
